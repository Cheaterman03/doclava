#summary Various ways to customize your documentation

== Simple Customizations ==

=== Add a title ===

You can set a title for your project by passing an [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_Data_Format HDF] variable as an argument to doclava. Add the argument:

{{{ -hdf project.name "Your Project's Name" }}}

=== Change the style ===

By default, Doclava includes an empty "assets/customizations.css" file as the last included css file. By overriding this file, you can modify the look and feel of your page.

To include your own customizations, add an argument:

{{{ -templatedir my_template_dir }}}

By specifying this directory, you can override any of the built-in assets and templates . An example custom template directory might have the following structure:

{{{
  my_template_dir/
      assets/
         customizations.css
         customizations.js
      components/
         api_filter.cs
         left_nav.cs
         masthead.cs
         search_box.cs
      customizations.cs
      footer.cs
}}}
