#summary How to federate your documentation.

= Federated Documentation =

Doclava supports federated documentation. If your project depends on another project with publicly available source code, Doclava can automatically create links to classes and methods in the remote site.

Federation requires two things: an available documentation site, and a machine-readable description of the site's contents. Doclava uses an .xml file for this description.

For documentation sites built with Doclava, this file is automatically placed in the generated documentation, and so federation can be configured with the arguments:

{{{
  -federate Project http://project.com/reference
}}}

For other projects, you can generate an xml file for the codebase with arguments:

{{{
  -nodocs -apixml path/to/api.xml
}}}

and then federate against existing documentation with:
{{{
  -federate Project http://project.com/reference
  -federationxml Project path/to/api.xml
}}}

The federation xml file may be a local file or an http link. We have several [http://doclava.googlecode.com/svn/static/api/ sample api.xml] files available for use.
