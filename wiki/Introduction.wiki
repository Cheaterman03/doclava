=Doclava=

Doclava is a custom javadoc doclet used to generate documentation. Doclava was forked from the Android build system for use on any Java project, and is used to generate the Android SDK.

Key differences between Doclava and the standard doclet include:
  * Ability to embed javadocs in a larger web page.
  * Refreshed look and feel, including search capabilities.
  * Support a templating engine for user customizations.
  * Throw build errors for things that can easily be caught, like @param tags that don't match the parameter names.
  * Ability to include snippets of code from real source code, so we know it at least compiles.
  * Federate documentation between multiple sites.

Doclava uses [http://www.clearsilver.net/ Clearsilver] as its templating engine.

== Using Doclava ==
Doclava can be used as a standard Doclet, and can be run through the Ant or Maven build systems.
